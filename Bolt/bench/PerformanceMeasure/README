* Copy the clBolt.Bench.Benchmark.exe to a separate folder along with all python scripts and run RUN_BENCHMARK.py python script
* This will benchmark the Routines for data type DATA_TYPE which is a MACRO in the Benchmark.cpp file. Set it to the Appropriate
    data type for which you want to Benchmark. ie unsigned int, float, double etc.
    And build Benchmark project to get the Required clBolt.Bench.Benchmark.exe
	
* This will create the some comparison graphs.
* BUT Before Running this script make sure your system must have PYTHON installed ( python-2.7.3.msi )
